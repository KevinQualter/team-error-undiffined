I found code on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18777893/jframe-background-image to handle 
a background image, while this helped me load an image to the background it was not in a way that we could use for
our game but rather our menu.

For the duration of this week so far I have been looking into layouts, this will help kill two birds with one stone
as we can use a card layout to flip between a menu and then the game and a standard border layout for the actual
game once we get it running. I am Keeping the JLabel code for an image in hopes of being able to implement this as
a menu in a stable release.

Today is the day we submit our work in progress and for the duration of the day we were working on that.  For the 
next WIP period these journals will hopefully be daily to journalize a more accurate order of events for this period

Worked on the menu screen today; experimenting with the card layout tomorrow to switch between the game screen and the menu.

Last week, I got a cardlayout working in which buttons would bring the end user to different panels when clicked. The
Problem with this was the placement of the buttons.  To solve this issue I am experimenting with gridlayout to reach the 
button placement desired.

This week I have been working on getting the cardlayout to work, combined to dealing with the frustration of being
behind and being surpassed.  The cardlayout works, but the button is beside the image not on top of it.  Instead of
the button being a breakthrough it has just been an extra headache.  My nesting may be to specific with each panel
having its own class.

Throughout our projects life cycle so far, Team management has declined and we have not been working in unison.
In addition to this, because some members need extra help with their code...  actually coding has not been at a 12U
level.
To fix this I have set up a plan of action:
	Once a day, team will meet before,during or after class to discuss difficulties.
	I will document the problems so that there is a clear objective for the next day.
	Kevin and Ashton are now working side-by-side, as they were working on two very similar things.

With this plan of action I hope to catch problems preemptively before they become a much grander problem.

We reset our frame size to a fixed position to avoid inconsistan

24/10/2014

-I started learning animation. The sprite sheet supposedly is separated in the program, 
 But I am yet to figure out how to call on it.

03/11/2014
-Made Game over Screen

04/11/2014
-I rearranged my animation test.

06/11/2014
-Close to animation Working, but keep getting “java.lang.NullPointerException” on attempted add to pane

13/11/2014
-The team and I decided to change how we animate: we are now doing individual image loading rather than the sprite-sheet-style. I have a plan of how to do this, and am much relived because for the past 3 days I have been struggling to learn sprite sheets.

“java.lang.NullPointerException” still blocks my adepts to draw an image
